# fixer
A program which fetches fixes (scripts) for issues/bugs from a server and applies the fix.

## How to install
Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ubuntu-Unity/fixer/master/fixer, and copy it to a directory in your PATH, like `/usr/bin`. 

### Configuration File (NEEDED TO OPERATE)
A configuration file is needed to operate. Please download https://github.com/Ubuntu-Unity/fixer/raw/master/ubuntu-unity/fixer.conf for Ubuntu Unity and copy it to /etc/fixer.conf. If you want to switch from the Ubuntu Unity Archive (if you are using another Unix-like operating system or Linux Distribution), change the SOURCE variable in /etc/fixer.conf
